# Virtual Environments
venv/          # The virtual environment contains specific dependencies and doesn't need to be tracked; it can be recreated easily.
.env/          # Environment configuration files (such as environment variables) contain sensitive, machine-specific data.

# Python compiled files
*.pyc          # These are cache files generated by Python, unnecessary for the project and can be regenerated automatically.
__pycache__/   # Directory containing `.pyc` compiled files, which Python generates automatically.

# Editor/IDE configuration files
.vscode/        # Files and configurations specific to Visual Studio Code, not necessary for other collaborators.

# Log files
*.log           # Log files contain temporary information about the code's execution, and are not necessary in the repository.

# Generated files such as CSV, Pickle, etc.
*.csv           # Generated data files that can be recreated from the code and don't need to be versioned.
*.pkl           # Pickle files used to serialize Python objects, usually large and can be recreated, so not necessary to track.
